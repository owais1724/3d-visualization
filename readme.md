3D In-Vitro Lead Qualification Dashboard

A Streamlit-based web application that identifies, enriches, and ranks life-science professionals based on their probability of working with 3D in-vitro models for drug discovery and safety assessment.

This project demonstrates a business-development intelligence workflow combining lead identification, enrichment, and propensity scoring.

🚀 Project Objective

The goal of this tool is to help business development teams prioritize high-quality leads who are most likely to adopt 3D in-vitro models in research and preclinical safety programs.

The system follows three core stages:

Identification – Target relevant life-science professionals

Enrichment – Add contextual, scientific, and business signals

Ranking – Compute a probability score (0–100) for prioritization
